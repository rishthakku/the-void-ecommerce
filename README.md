# The Void - A Satirical E-commerce Landing Page

**"Your Satisfaction is Irrelevant"**

This is a foundational front-end project I created before building the KISS social app. The goal was to master the fundamentals of modern web layout and basic interactivity using HTML, CSS, and a small amount of vanilla JavaScript.

The project is a static, single-page website with a satirical theme, designed to practice and demonstrate core skills in a creative way.

### Core Concepts Demonstrated

*   **Modern Two-Column Layout with CSS Grid:** The entire page structure is built on a CSS Grid, with a fixed sidebar and a scrollable main content areaâ€”a common pattern in modern web design.
*   **Interactive Slide-Out Menu with Vanilla JS:** The "All Categories" menu is fully functional, appearing and disappearing based on user clicks. This was achieved with a simple, efficient vanilla JavaScript snippet that manipulates CSS classes.
*   **Semantic HTML Structure:** The document is structured using semantic tags like `<aside>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` for improved accessibility and SEO.
*   **Advanced CSS Styling:** The project showcases a strong command of CSS, including:
    *   **Flexbox** for aligning items within components.
    *   **Transitions and Transforms** for the smooth slide-out menu animation.
    *   **Pseudo-classes** like `:hover` and `:focus` for interactive feedback.
    *   The `box-sizing: border-box` model for a predictable layout.

### Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3**
*   **Vanilla JavaScript** (for DOM manipulation)

### How to Run

1.  Download or clone the repository.
2.  Make sure you have placeholder images named `hero_image.jpg`, `box1_image.jpg`, etc., in the same folder.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.

### My Learning Journey

As an earlier project, this was crucial for my understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together.
